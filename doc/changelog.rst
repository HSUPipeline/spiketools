Code Changelog
==============

This page contains the changelog for the `spiketools` module and any notes on updating between versions.

This page primarily notes changes for major version updates. For notes on the specific updates
for minor releases, see the `release page <https://github.com/spiketools/spiketools/releases>`_.

0.X.X Series
------------

The 0.X.X series is the initial and current release series.

0.1.0
~~~~~

The 0.1.0 release is the current stable release of spiketools.

Version 0.1.0 is the first proper stable release of the module. As such, it establishes the basic organization
of the module, which will be stable from here in future updates (unless and until there is a major / breaking change).

Note that while the 0.1.0 release is broadly consistent with the previous 0.0.0 release,
there are some small breaking changes.

0.0.0
~~~~~

The 0.0.0 release is the initial 'alpha' release of the module.

This release series contains code working with spiking data, including measures and conversions,
spatial analyses, statistical analyses, simulations, and plotting.
